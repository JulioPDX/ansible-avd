# Release Notes for Ansible AVD 4.x.x

## Release 4.0.0

### Changes to eos_config_deploy_cvp role

- **cv_collection defaults to v3:**
  - `v1` will be removed in CVP version 4.0, it's highly recommended moving to the `v3` collection.
  - If you would like to continue using the `v1` collection, set the `cv_collection` variable to `v1` in future playbooks.

    ```yaml
    tasks:
      - name: Provision CVP with AVD configuration
        import_role:
          name: eos_config_deploy_cvp
        vars:
          container_root: 'ATD_FABRIC'
          configlets_prefix: 'AVD'
          state: present
          cv_collection: v1
    ```
